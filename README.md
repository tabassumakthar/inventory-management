# 🏬 Inventory Management System (DBMS Project - MySQL)

Inventory is the backbone of any product-based business. This system ensures that stock levels are efficiently managed, suppliers are tracked, and customer orders are fulfilled accurately and on time. By using a structured MySQL database, this project supports seamless tracking of inventory across suppliers, warehouses, and customers.

## 📖 Introduction

Inventory management involves tracking the movement of products from suppliers to warehouses and finally to customers. This project focuses on:

- Monitoring product levels in real time.
- Managing multiple warehouses.
- Maintaining supplier and customer records.
- Executing SQL queries for data analysis and transactions.

> 📝 *Note: The product names, suppliers, and customers in this project are inspired by characters and items from the TV show* **F.R.I.E.N.D.S**, *used here creatively to make the database more engaging and relatable.*
